              {{"I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the psychiatry department at Harvard Medical School / Massachusetts General Hospital. My research interests pertain to leveraging state-of-the-art statistical approaches to address questions relating to the nosology and treatment of emotional disorders. Specifically, my research embraces statistical procedures that foster idiographic and precision medicine approaches to clinical psychology, such as intensive time-series research designs and machine learning approaches. These activities are complemented by my interests in philosophy of science. I received my PhD in clinical psychology from Boston University under the mentorship of Dr. Stefan Hofmann, and I completed my pre-doctoral internship in the CBT track at MGH/Harvard Medical School. Prior to pursuing my doctoral degree, I was a statistician and researcher in the clinical psychology department at Yale University for several years. I received my undergraduate degrees from Rutgers University in cognitive science, philosophy, and psychology." | markdownify }}
